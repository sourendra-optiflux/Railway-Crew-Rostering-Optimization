"""Build the fixed OptiFlux v2 tables (everything except the roster and the per-person tables).

Step 1 of 2. Step 2 is ``scripts/roster_making.py``, which builds the roster and,
from it, the crew list and the per-person tables.

Inputs (kept unchanged, for traceability):
    data/optiflux_v2/source/*.csv                      the four tables as uploaded
    data/optiflux_v2/source/rules/*.txt                the rule notes as supplied
    data/optiflux_v2/source/from_generated_small/*.csv compliance matrix and priority list of the old data

Outputs (overwritten):
    activities_df.csv, activity_demand_df.csv, activity_priority.csv, excluded_activities.csv,
    compliance_matrix_df.csv, constraints_df.csv,
    crew_restrictions.csv, Crew_Onsite_App.csv            (header only: no leave, no check-ins yet)

Every change is explained in Progress/real_data_understanding/03_data_changes.md.
The script uses only the standard library and is deterministic.
